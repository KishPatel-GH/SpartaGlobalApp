# SpartaGlobalApp

## Project Overview

### Application Description

This application will allow Sparta Global trainers to set questions to their trainees so they can practice and learn relevant material tailored to their course. Trainers will have the option to create, read, update and delete questions that can be later posed to their trainees. Trainees will be able to provide their responses to these questions and receive personal feedback from their trainer.

## Sprint Breakdowns

### Sprint 1 - Tuesday 1st December 2020

#### Sprint Overview

Within the first sprint I aimed to set-up the three layers of the application and ensure the database is created correctly. The business and user interface levels must also have the correct dependencies in order for the application to work.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 0.1: Set-up Model
- [x] Complete User Story 0.2: Set-up  User Interface 
- [x] Complete User Story 0.3 Set-up Business Layer
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

The database first method proved a useful approach to setting up the database. There were a few difficulties with creating the database that caused a few minor setbacks, however this time was made up for by the simplicity of setting up and connecting the business and interface levels.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Using online walkthroughs and Microsoft documentations seem to improve productivity. This approach will be useful when it comes to creating CRUD functionality in the business layer. This sprint has shown that I am able to work faster than anticipated, and that I can set myself more goals in future sprints.

### Sprint 2 - Wednesday 2nd December 2020

#### Sprint Overview

Today's sprint involved implementing the CRUD functionality of the application in the business layer and then testing it within the NUNIT test layer. The application passed all the tests so far and has the basic CRUD functions described by the sprint goals.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 1.1: CRUD Questions/Answers
- [x] Complete User Story 1.2: Pose Questions to Trainees
- [x] Complete User Story 1.3: Registration Page
- [x] Complete User Story 2.1: Submit Answers to Trainers
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

There were a few minor difficulties in managing the primary and foreign keys of the tables in the database. However, these issues were discovered during unit testing and were then resolved in the CRUD manager layer.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Today I found I was able to work much faster than yesterday, this may be due to the natural learning curve of understanding my project more and knowing exactly what I want it to do. Using previous examples related to CRUD functionality proved extremely useful as I was able to identify and avoid errors I had faced in the past. I had set myself an appropriate workload for today by reflecting on yesterday's retrospective.

### Sprint 3 - Thursday 3rd December 2020

#### Sprint Overview

In this sprint, I aimed to create a user interface for the login and home pages of the application. This would also require coding an appropriate login system in the code behind of the XAML.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 3.1: Appearance
- [ ] Complete User Story 3.2: GUI Windows
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

The application now has a functioning login system where a user is directed to their respective homepage. However, I was not able to complete the user interface for the homepage and implement the CRUD functionality.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Today's sprint taught me to focus on the functionality of the application rather than the appearance of the user interface. I found that I dedicated too much time to the aesthetics of the login page, which meant I was unable to complete the home page. However, on a positive note I noticed myself becoming more familiar with XAML and hence more productive towards the end of the sprint.

### Sprint 4 - Friday 4th December 2020

![alt text](https://github.com/KishPatel-GH/SpartaGlobalApp/blob/main/image/sprint4ss.png?raw=true)

#### Sprint Overview

In todays sprint I needed to complete the functionality of the interface, this means I would be able to perform all CRUD functionality from the GUI layer. I had also planned to complete the remainder of the previous sprint.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 3.1: Appearance
- [x] Complete User Story 3.2: GUI Windows
- [x] Complete User Story 2.2: Learn from mistakes
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

Today was very productive, early on I faced a blocker which prevented me from defining the source of the list boxes in the GUI. However, some help from Microsoft documentation online, I was able to solve this problem and continue with the project. Once I had the majority of the GUI working, it became significantly easier to complete the rest, and hence productivity was at a high.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Today's lesson learnt is that it is crucial to remain open-minded in projects. When faced with the list box blocker, I was adamant in making my approach work, rather than start over and tackle the problem from a different angle. However, it proved much quicker and simpler to analyse the problem faced, and alter my approach.

### Sprint 5 - Saturday 5th December 2020

![alt text](https://github.com/KishPatel-GH/SpartaGlobalApp/blob/main/image/sprint5ss.png?raw=true)

#### Sprint Overview

The plan for todays sprint was to complete the application by decorating the GUI and implementing any finishing touches. Then to complete all appropriate documentation and push the whole folder to GitHub.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 4.1: Decorate GUI
- [x] Complete User Story 3.3: Remember Me
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

A fairly straight-forward sprint, I did not face any blockers today and I was able to complete all my objectives smoothly.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Today I learnt how to show and hide separate windows within the GUI layer, this was a confusing concept at first but after some research it proved a very useful skill to pick up.

## Project Review

I am proud to say that the project MVP was met and hence the project has been a success. I have yet to add one more user story to complete the application, but the current application runs smoothly and achieves all intended purposes. The user interface has been manual tested and the agile documentation has been completed and committed to GitHub.

## Project Retrospective

The early stages of the project were quite intimidating at first, however by keeping faith in the structure of my sprints I was able to stay on top of my tasks and complete the project in the allocated time. As the project progressed I gained confidence and efficiency in programming, as well as learning a wide range of coding techniques.
