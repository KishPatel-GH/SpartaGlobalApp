# SpartaGlobalApp

## Project Overview

### Application Description

This application will allow Sparta Global trainers to set questions to their trainees so they can practice and learn relevant material tailored to their course. Trainers will have the option to create, read, update and delete questions that can be later posed to their trainees. Trainees will be able to provide their responses to these questions and receive personal feedback from their trainer.

##### Sprint Overview

Within the first sprint I aimed to set-up the three layers of the application and ensure the database is created correctly. The business and user interface levels must also have the correct dependencies in order for the application to work.

##### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 0.1
- [x] Complete User Story 0.2
- [x] Complete User Story 0.3
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

##### Sprint Review

The database first method proved a useful approach to setting up the database. There were a few difficulties with creating the database that caused a few minor setbacks, however this time was made up for by the simplicity of setting up and connecting the business and interface levels.

##### Sprint Retrospective

Using online walkthroughs and Microsoft documentations seem to improve productivity. This approach will be useful when it comes to creating CRUD functionality in the business layer. This sprint has shown that I am able to work faster than anticipated, and that I can set myself more goals in future sprints.
