# SpartaGlobalApp

## Project Overview

### Application Description

This application will allow Sparta Global trainers to set questions to their trainees so they can practice and learn relevant material tailored to their course. Trainers will have the option to create, read, update and delete questions that can be later posed to their trainees. Trainees will be able to provide their responses to these questions and receive personal feedback from their trainer.
