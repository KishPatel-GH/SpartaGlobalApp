# SpartaGlobalApp

## Project Overview

### Application Description

This application will allow Sparta Global trainers to set questions to their trainees so they can practice and learn relevant material tailored to their course. Trainers will have the option to create, read, update and delete questions that can be later posed to their trainees. Trainees will be able to provide their responses to these questions and receive personal feedback from their trainer.

## Sprint Breakdowns

### Sprint 1 - Tuesday 1st December 2020

#### Sprint Overview

Within the first sprint I aimed to set-up the three layers of the application and ensure the database is created correctly. The business and user interface levels must also have the correct dependencies in order for the application to work.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 0.1: Set-up Model
- [x] Complete User Story 0.2: Set-up  User Interface 
- [x] Complete User Story 0.3 Set-up Business Layer
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

The database first method proved a useful approach to setting up the database. There were a few difficulties with creating the database that caused a few minor setbacks, however this time was made up for by the simplicity of setting up and connecting the business and interface levels.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Using online walkthroughs and Microsoft documentations seem to improve productivity. This approach will be useful when it comes to creating CRUD functionality in the business layer. This sprint has shown that I am able to work faster than anticipated, and that I can set myself more goals in future sprints.

### Sprint 2 - Wednesday 2nd December 2020

#### Sprint Overview

Today's sprint involved implementing the CRUD functionality of the application in the business layer and then testing it within the NUNIT test layer. The application passed all the tests so far and has the basic CRUD functions described by the sprint goals.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 1.1: CRUD Questions/Answers
- [x] Complete User Story 1.2: Pose Questions to Trainees
- [x] Complete User Story 1.3: Registration Page
- [x] Complete User Story 2.1: Submit Answers to Trainers
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

There were a few minor difficulties in managing the primary and foreign keys of the tables in the database. However, these issues were discovered during unit testing and were then resolved in the CRUD manager layer.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Today I found I was able to work much faster than yesterday, this may be due to the natural learning curve of understanding my project more and knowing exactly what I want it to do. Using previous examples related to CRUD functionality proved extremely useful as I was able to identify and avoid errors I had faced in the past. I had set myself an appropriate workload for today by reflecting on yesterday's retrospective.

### Sprint 3 - Thursday 3rd December 2020

#### Sprint Overview

In this sprint, I aimed to create a user interface for the login and home pages of the application. This would also require coding an appropriate login system in the code behind of the XAML.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 3.1: Appearance
- [ ] Complete User Story 3.2: GUI Windows
- [x] Update Readme file
- [x] Push to GitHub

#### Sprint Review

The application now has a functioning login system where a user is directed to their respective homepage. However, I was not able to complete the user interface for the homepage and implement the CRUD functionality.

#### Sprint Retrospective

Today's sprint taught me to focus on the functionality of the application rather than the appearance of the user interface. I found that I dedicated too much time to the aesthetics of the login page, which meant I was unable to complete the home page. However, on a positive note I noticed myself becoming more familiar with XAML and hence more productive towards the end of the sprint.
